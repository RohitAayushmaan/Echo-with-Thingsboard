# Echo-with-Thingsboard

## Objective

The Echo-with-Thingsboard project is implemented to demonstrate how to echo data read from Thingsboard shared attributes to telemetry by using Python. The project sets up a connection to Thingsboard, continuously monitors a shared attribute with the key 'data' from a specific device, and sends this data to telemetry as 'echo_data' whenever it changes.
